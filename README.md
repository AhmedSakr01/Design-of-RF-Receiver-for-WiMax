# Design-of-RF-Receiver-for-WiMax
In this project, possible LNA, Mixer and VCO suitable for RF front-ends of wireless receivers are proposed. The main objective in the project is to meet the requirements of the IEEE 802.16m Standard for WiMAX. <br/>
<br/>
	*The proposed LNA is capable of providing high power gain in the 3.25 GHz band with a gain of 21 dB, on-chip input matching circuit, and high reverse isolation. The LNA is a differential type CMOS amplifier following a stage that converts the single ended signal from the antenna to a differential signal.<br/>
	*A Gilbert-cell down-converting mixer was designed for integrated receiver front-ends. This mixer is suitable for RF receivers that require IF output of 250 MHz. The gain of this mixer equals 10.5 dBm, with noise figure of 11.9 dBm. <br/>
	*In this research, a voltage controlled oscillator design is proposed. The generated signal has a frequency of 3.016-2.985 GHz, phase noise of -116.2 dBc @ 1 MHz and output power of 4.1 dBm.<br/>
<br/>
Each design in this research is implemented using TSMC 130nm and TSMC 180nm, the EDA programs are Agilent Advanced design system 2009 and Cadence Virtuoso. Layouts are designed using Cadence Virtuoso and Tanner tools.
